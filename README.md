==========================

This program executes the basics of a paging on a 32-bit vitual address with a 4-KB page size. This program can be run through the main method in class Test which will prompt the user for an address, or this program can use the PageTable class directly (if they wish to use there own Test class or soforth). Running the program from the Test class, until the program is closed, it will prompt the user for an addrress. This address will then be sent to the PageTable class where it will have the page number and offset returned to the user.
